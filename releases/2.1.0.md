# NEW HOST LOGGER

* `BasicStdOut` host logger was deprecated and `CommandLine` host logger was added. This logger will write to the correct
system file depending on the type of error. Error log will now write to `stderr` info and warning logs will write to
`stdout`. `BasicStdOut` was kept for backwards compatibility but it should no longer be used.
