# BREAKING CHANGES

* Datadog metric name will no longer include the environment. The environment of the application should be determined 
by the server the application is deployed on not the application itself. This will break Datadog graphs and monitors.
    * Old - DATADOG_PROJECT_NAME.DATADOG_ENVIRONMENT.suffix
    * New - DATADOG_PROJECT_NAME.suffix

# DEPRECATED
* Datadog `Decrement` and `Increment` methods have been deprecated by Datadog. I've flagged these as deprecated in the
source code, the code for both of these will be kept but you should no longer use them since datadog will remove their
support at some point.

# REMOVED
* `DATADOG_ENVIRONMENT` ENV variable is deprecated and no longer used by the package.
* `SystemLogger` constructor no longer accept an injection, `__construct($errorLogger = null)` this wasn't used anywhere internally 
since early beta and therefore was removed from the source code. If you have any code that injects something when
constructing system logger you should update it.
